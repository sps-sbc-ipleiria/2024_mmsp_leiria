                <b>Abstract:</b>
                Visual communications have a fundamental role in Human societies. In the digital era, this has led to the explosion of image and video-based applications and services, notably following the democratization of image and video acquisition, storage and streaming. However, conventional image and video-based experiences are far from the real-world immersion; this has motivated a rush for more realistic, immersive and interactive visual experiences, notably offering 6-DoF (Degrees-Of-Freedom) experiences where the user is free to exploit the six translational and rotational types of motion, possible in the real world.
                <p class="text-muted mb-3" style="text-align: justify;">Recent years have seen a growing wave of data driven algorithms, such as deep neural networks, which have taken a lead role in many research and development areas, especially in multimedia. This interest is driven by several factors, notably advances in processing power, availability of large data sets, and algorithmic advances. Deep learning (DL)-based solutions are the state-of-the-art for multiple computer vision tasks, both high- and low-level. These advances have led to the exploitation of DL-based tools in the visual coding domain, reaching competitive performance in a short time.</p>
                <p class="text-muted mb-3" style="text-align: justify;">The potential of this type of coding approach has been recognized by JPEG and MPEG which have already developed DL-based coding standards, and more are coming. These standards demonstrate that, after many years of developments and advances with hand-crafted coding tools, the visual coding landscape is facing a revolution with the emergence of DL-based technology, which has the potential to unify several visual modalities under the same technological umbrella, offering compressed visual representations able to simultaneously and effectively serving humans and machines. In this context, this talk will address the recent trends on image and video coding standardization.</p>

                <b>Abstract:</b>
                The recent developments on high-quality equipment for images and video visualization created a general demand for novel models of quality assessment. Typically, image and video representation methods use lossy compression models that produce visible distortions, which affect the perceived experience. For the quality evaluation of such distortions, subjective quality evaluations are usually conducted, followed by the adoption of objective metrics validated upon the subjective evaluations.
                <p class="text-muted mb-3" style="text-align: justify;">A generic description of the current quality assessment methodologies will be given, and some limitations will be identified. Those limitations are the basis of current research on visual quality assessment, leading to new subjective quality evaluation approaches that target near-visually lossless distortion evaluation or models for quality evaluation of immersive and 3D visual data. Current challenges will be identified.</p>

            <p class="text-muted mb-3" style="text-align: justify;">
                <b>Abstract:</b>
                The demand for more immersive and interactive experiences has driven the use of new 3D multimedia formats, more fitted to virtual and augmented reality applications. Among these formats, point clouds (PCs) have gained relevance, due to their ability to represent the scenes’ 3D visual information, using a set of points and associated attributes, notably color. To offer realistic and immersive experiences, PCs need millions, or even billions, of points, thus asking for efficient representation and coding solutions, which are critical for the practical deployment of emerging applications and services. 
                <p class="text-muted mb-3" style="text-align: justify;">This presentation will describe the state-of-the-art of point cloud coding, with a focus on the potential of learning-based coding solutions, including a description of the new JPEG Pleno Point Cloud Coding (PCC) standard. The presentation compares the compression approaches and performance of learning-based PCC methods with previous conventional PCC solutions. Furthermore, the presentation highlights the potential of learning-based coding methods to offer an effective, common, unique representation for both human visualization and machine consumption. By using compressed domain processing techniques, which use the same features extracted by the PC encoder which are used for decoding the PC for human visualization, computer vision algorithms avoid the traditional performance and complexity penalties associated with the decoding process.</p>

                <b>Abstract:</b>
                The emergence of sophisticated 3D representation models has revolutionized the field of computer vision and graphics, providing unprecedented capabilities in rendering and understanding complex scenes. This presentation delves into two cutting-edge methodologies: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting, both of which have shown remarkable potential in creating highly detailed and realistic 3D reconstructions.
                <p class="text-muted mb-3" style="text-align: justify;">NeRFs leverage neural networks to represent a scene as a continuous 3D volume, enabling high-fidelity rendering from sparse and unstructured image collections. By optimizing the parameters of the neural network, NeRFs can synthesize novel views of a scene with stunning accuracy and detail. This technique has significantly impacted various applications, from virtual reality to photorealistic rendering in visual effects.</p>
                <p class="text-muted mb-3" style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, 3D Gaussian Splatting offers a novel approach to 3D representation by utilizing a set of Gaussian functions to model the geometry and appearance of objects. This method provides a flexible and efficient framework for capturing the nuances of a scene, including fine details and complex lighting effects. 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown promise in scenarios where traditional mesh-based approaches fall short, particularly in representing soft and translucent objects.</p>
                <p class="text-muted mb-3" style="text-align: justify;">This presentation will explore the underlying principles of NeRFs and 3D Gaussian Splatting, highlighting their unique advantages and limitations, demonstrating how these models are transforming 3D representations, and discussing future directions and potential applications.</p>

            <p class="text-muted mb-3" style="text-align: justify;">
                <b>Abstract:</b>
                Light fields are a simplification of the 7D plenoptic function in which the visual information can be encoded as a matrix of views. As such, they inherently generate a large amount of data, which asks for efficient coding techniques. This talk will briefly discuss the past, present, and future of light field coding. We start with pseudo-video-based techniques using efficient video coders and multiview extensions of video coding algorithms. Then, we will pass through the interview prediction methods based on view synthesis techniques. Techniques that directly exploit the 4D redundancy of light fields, such as the ones based on 4D transforms, will then be dealt with. The talk ends with an overview of learning-based methods, including the ones based on implicit representations.

            <h5 class="title text-center" id="speaker2">Paulo Nunes (University Institute of Lisbon / Instituto de Telecomunicações)</h5>
            <p class="text-muted mb-3" style="text-align: justify;">
                <b>Abstract:</b>
                Light Field (LF) imaging is a promising solution for providing more immersive and closer to reality multimedia experiences to end-users with unprecedented creative freedom and flexibility for applications in different areas, such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), cinematography, three-dimensional (3D) television, biometric recognition, and medical imaging.
                <p class="text-muted mb-3" style="text-align: justify;">LFs enable capturing both light intensity and direction information of a scene in a Four-Dimensional (4D) array, known as the 4D LF. The rich information included in 4D LFs enables the viewer to explore the scene from different perspectives, hence, enhancing depth perception and realism. However, the promise of an immersive experience comes with challenges that need to be investigated, notably in terms of processing and editing. One example of those challenges is to efficiently process/edit 4D LFs by exploiting the spatio-angular correlations while ensuring spatial accuracy and angular consistency. This challenge is tackled through several methods that together form a pipeline to efficiently process/edit 4D LFs.</p>
                <p class="text-muted mb-3" style="text-align: justify;">At first, an efficient disparity propagation method that enables computing angularly consistent disparity maps for all LF views is presented. Afterwards, novel over-segmentation methods that rely on disparity maps as an additional guiding feature to group corresponding pixels across LF views into spatio-angular segments are briefly described. To illustrate the benefits of these solutions, over-segmented 4D LFs are then used as an intermediate representation that enables LF segmentation and facilitates neural style transfer propagation.</p>
                <p class="text-muted mb-3" style="text-align: justify;">Finally, it will be shown that representing 4D LFs based on over-segmentation allows the usage of classical graph cut and graph neural networks to achieve efficient and angularly consistent 4D LF mid-level segmentation.</p>

                <p class="text-muted mb-3" style="text-align: justify;">In summary, this talk presents recent advances and possible future research directions on the processing of this immersive imaging modality that is beyond the traditional 2D images and provides a more realistic experience to the end users.</p>
